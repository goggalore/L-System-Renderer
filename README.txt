An L-System Renderer created on Codepen.io from scratch as a personal project. Visit the application at https://codepen.io/Goggalor/full/WEoKXE/

Note that this code was written as my very first interaction with Javascript and as my first, self motivated project from scratch. 
For a more reflective version of my current coding style, please view my Instant-Japanese repo.
